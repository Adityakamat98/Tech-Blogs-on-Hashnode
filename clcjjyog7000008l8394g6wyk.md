As a power user, you are always looking for ways to optimize your workflow and get more done.

Whether you're looking to define custom window layouts, quickly launch programs and documents, or bulk rename files, PowerToys has a tool for you.

# What is Microsoft Power Toys?

PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Developed by Microsoft, PowerToys provides a set of tools for users of Windows to fine-tune their systems and personalize their desktop experience. I have included some of my Favourite Utilities which I use Daily.

1. **FancyZones**

    As someone who frequently multitasks and has a lot of windows open at once, I find that FancyZones helps me stay organized and focused. With FancyZones, I can define custom window layouts for different tasks and quickly snap windows into those layouts with just a few clicks. This helps me avoid the clutter and disorganization that can come with having too many windows on my desktop. I also appreciate the ability to customize the layout and behaviour of FancyZones to suit my needs and preferences.
    
2. **File Explorer add-ons**

    File Explorer Add-ons are a set of tools that enhance the functionality of File Explorer in Windows. These add-ons include a preview pane for audio and video files, a ribbon optimizer, and a thumbnail cache cleaner. The preview pane allows you to view audio and video files directly within File Explorer, saving you the time and effort of having to open them in a separate application. The ribbon optimizer removes unused tabs and buttons from the File Explorer ribbon, decluttering the interface and making it easier to find the options you need. The thumbnail cache cleaner clears the thumbnail cache, which can help free up disk space and improve the performance of File Explorer.
    
3. **PowerToys Run**

    PowerToys Run is a quick launch utility that makes it easy for me to open programs and documents on my Windows PC. All I have to do is press the <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and start typing the name of the program or document I want to open.  
    *PS: This does a Universal Search which can detect file types, calculate numbers and much more. When I turn on my computer, this is one of the first things I use.*
    
4. **Text Extractor**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1672948928783/670c5dfa-4e66-42eb-9f57-ada0bd39e917.gif align="center")
    
    As someone who frequently works with scanned documents and images, I often need to extract text from these files for further processing or analysis. Text Extractor is a convenient way to copy text from anywhere on your screen. To activate, use the shortcut <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
    
5. **Shortcut Guide**

    This would be my most loved feature from Power Toys, I love the convenience of being able to see a pop-up overlay with all the available keyboard shortcuts when I long press <kbd>Windows Logo Key</kbd> .This has helped me discover and use keyboard shortcuts that I didn't even know existed, saving me time and effort and making me more productive. I also appreciate the customization options that Shortcut Guide offers, such as the ability to show only the shortcuts for a specific application or to exclude certain shortcuts from the overlay
    

There are so many other useful utilities everyone should check out. I have just mentioned some of my favourites.
