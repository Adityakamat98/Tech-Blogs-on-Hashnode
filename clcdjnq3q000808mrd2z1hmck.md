# My Journey So Far - Dev Retro 2022

As I reflect on my journey as a QA Engineer over the past year, I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. While the road has not always been easy, the challenges I faced have ultimately made me a stronger and more skilled engineer.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was learning how to effectively communicate with my team. As a QA Engineer, it is my responsibility to ensure that all aspects of a project are tested and functioning properly. However, this can often involve working closely with developers and other team members, and it can be difficult to effectively convey the importance of certain issues or defects.

Through trial and error, I learned how to effectively communicate my findings and concerns to my team clearly and concisely. I also learned the importance of being open to feedback and suggestions from my colleagues, as this helped to improve the overall quality of our projects.

Another challenge I faced was keeping up with the constantly evolving nature of technology. The field of QA Engineering is constantly changing, and it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest tools and techniques. This can be overwhelming at times, but I learned to embrace the challenge and make a conscious effort to continuously learn and improve my skills.

Despite these challenges, I have also achieved many accomplishments during my journey. One of my proudest moments was leading a successful QA effort on a major project from the Netherlands. This project required me to get the Feature for an App, and I learned valuable skills in User Experience and project management.

Overall, my journey as a QA Engineer has been a rewarding and challenging experience. I have learned so much about effective communication, open to feedback and I am excited to see where my career takes me in the future.
